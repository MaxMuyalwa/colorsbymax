# colorsbymax™

**by mrmaxdesigns**

A floating theme switcher for websites. Visitors (or the site's owner) can re-colour the whole site instantly: pick one of the site's own themes, a hand-tuned pick, or one of 715 library themes in 14 categories; build and share custom palettes; or override single colours. Every theme is checked against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) contrast rules, with one-click fixes.

## Features

- **Site themes first.** The panel opens on a group named after the site, holding its own colours. If those fail contrast, an accessible version is generated automatically.
- **Scan the site.** Press "Scan site" and colorsbymax reads the colours actually painted on the page (ignoring any theme it has applied, and including gradients). It works out the page background, surfaces, text and brand colours, then adds themes named after the site: Scanned (as found), Accessible, Soft, Bold, Complementary, and the closest library matches. Scans run only when asked, and the results are remembered.
- **Max’s picks and library.** 5 hand-tuned picks, plus 715 library themes (Bright, Fun, Pastel, Earth tones, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring, Ocean, Warm, Nature, Moody, Monochrome, Eclectic) with search and "Surprise me". The library loads only when the panel opens.
- **Custom palettes, single-colour overrides, JSON import/export.**
- **Palettes from images and PDFs.** In Import / export, upload or drop a mood board, screenshot, photo or brand guide. colorsbymax picks out its main colours (hex codes written in a PDF take priority), lets you leave any out, previews the palette it builds around them and saves it as a custom palette. Nothing leaves the browser; PDFs are read with [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/), downloaded only when a PDF is picked.
- **Contrast checks.** Problems show as a badge on the theme; the breakdown offers per-item fixes or "Fix all automatically", which changes lightness only.
- **No flash on reload.** An inline pre-paint script applies the saved theme before the page draws.
- **Works on any site.** The panel carries its own stylesheet inside a shadow root, so it needs no Tailwind or other CSS from the site, and the site's CSS can't restyle it.
- **Movable colour button.** The floating button starts in the corner; visitors can drag it anywhere (mouse or touch; a tooltip says so on hover, and the panel closes while it moves) and it stays there, remembered across reloads. The panel then opens beside it, on whichever side has room. Its dot cycles through the current theme's colours.
- **Light and dark mode.** Every built-in theme is designed light; dark mode lists a generated dark twin of each (dark surfaces, light text, brand colours lifted to read on dark, then contrast-fixed) and switches the current theme to its twin. The panel turns dark with it. Custom palettes stay as they were made.
- **Visitor settings.** The gear in the panel header opens settings: theme mode (Light, Dark, Auto), panel size (Compact, Standard, Large), which groups and sections to show, whether the button can be dragged or its dot animates, and moving the button back to its corner. Saved per site.
- **Resizable panel.** Drag the panel's free edges or corner (the ones away from the colour button) to any size, or pick a size in settings; double-click an edge to reset it. The layout follows the panel's width, so a large panel shows three theme cards a row.
- **Clear groups and feedback.** The site's own group (globe), Max’s picks (paintbrush) and Yours (person) sit in their own row, apart from the library's categories. Toasts confirm what just happened; saving, importing or building a palette says it went to Yours and offers "Show" to jump straight to it. Tooltips are drawn in the panel's colours.
- **Themed scrollbars.** The page's scrollbars and the panel's slim one take the selected theme's primary colour. Turn the page's off with `scrollbars: false`.
- **Accessible panel.** A labelled dialog with focus trap, Escape, the colour button or an outside click to close, keyboard operable, and reduced-motion support.

## How it works

Every colour is one of 35 tokens (`primary`, `surface`, `ink`, `data-1`…), exposed as `--color-<token>` CSS variables. Applying a theme just sets those variables on `<html>`, so anything the site paints with `var(--color-primary)` (directly, or through Tailwind CSS v4 utilities like `bg-primary`) changes instantly. There's no rebuild and no re-render.

The switcher renders into a `<colorsbymax-root>` element on `<body>` with its own shadow root and stylesheet. Only the `--color-*` variables cross into it. With reduced motion, the colour button's dot holds still on the theme's primary colour.

## Try the demo

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This serves `demo/`: a fictional studio site built with Tailwind that uses every token group, and `/plain.html`, a plain-CSS bakery site with deliberately careless global styles to show they don't reach the panel.

## Add it to a site

1. **Paint the site with the token variables.** Use `var(--color-<token>)` wherever the site sets a colour, with your own colours as the starting values.

   With Tailwind CSS v4, import the defaults, override them, and use the token utilities (`bg-primary`, `text-ink`, …) instead of hard-coded colours:

   ```css
   @import "tailwindcss";
   @import "colorsbymax/tokens.css";

   @theme static {
     --color-primary: #c67cde; /* your colours */
   }
   ```

   With plain CSS, define the variables yourself (`demo/plain.html` shows this):

   ```css
   :root {
     --color-primary: #c67cde;
   }
   .button {
     background: var(--color-primary);
   }
   ```

2. **Wrap the app and render the switcher:**

   ```jsx
   import { ThemeProvider, ThemeSwitcher } from 'colorsbymax'

   <ThemeProvider config={config}>
     <App />
     <ThemeSwitcher />
   </ThemeProvider>
   ```

   The switcher needs React but not a React site: `demo/plain.jsx` mounts it on its own next to a static page.

3. **Add the pre-paint script** to `<head>`, as a classic inline `<script>`, using the same storage key. `prePaintScript(storageKey)` returns its source, and `demo/index.html` shows it in place.

Without a `siteName`, the site group is named from the page's `og:site_name`, its title or its host name.

### Config

```js
{
  siteName: 'Tsungi',               // name of the first theme group
  storageKey: 'tsungi-theme',       // localStorage key (match the pre-paint script)
  defaultTheme: { name, tokens },   // the site's own colours; missing tokens are filled in
  themes: [{ id, name, tokens }],   // optional extra themes made for the site
  usage: { primary: 'Buttons…' },   // optional notes shown in the colour editors
  scrollbars: true,                 // colour the page's scrollbars from the theme (default)
}
```

`examples/tsungi.config.js` is a complete example for tsungi.online, the first site to use colorsbymax.

## Panel styles

The panel is styled with Tailwind classes in `src/ThemePanel.jsx` and `src/ThemeSwitcher.jsx`. `scripts/build-css.mjs` compiles them, with `src/panel.css`, into `src/panel-css.generated.js`. The demo server does this automatically as you edit; otherwise run:

```bash
npm run css
```

## Regenerating the library

```bash
npm run presets
```

`scripts/generate-presets.mjs` turns each source palette into a full theme, auto-fixes contrast, drops anything that still fails or duplicates another theme, names it and tags its categories. Adjust the category rules at the top of the script.

## Notices

The library palettes come from [nice-color-palettes](https://github.com/Jam3/nice-color-palettes) (MIT). Its licence notice is in [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) and must ship with every copy.

PDF reading uses [pdfjs-dist](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) (Apache-2.0), installed as a dependency rather than bundled into colorsbymax.

## Licence

colorsbymax is released under the [MIT Licence](LICENSE). The names colorsbymax™ and mrmaxdesigns are marks of Max Muyalwa and aren't covered by the code licence.
